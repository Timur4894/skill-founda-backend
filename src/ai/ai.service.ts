## Entity Descriptions

**1. Roadmap**
- Main container for learning plan
- Contains: title, description
- Belongs to one user
- Contains multiple blocks (RoadmapItem)

**2. RoadmapItem (Roadmap Block)**
- Thematic section within roadmap
- Contains: title, description, order (sequence)
- Belongs to one roadmap
- Contains content: tasks, documentation, resources

**3. Task**
- Practical assignment to complete
- Contains: title, description, completed (status)
- Belongs to one roadmap block

**4. Documentation**
- Links to official documentation
- Contains: title, link
- Belongs to one roadmap block
